        <p>This is supposed to be my personal website. A single webpage in the immeasurably vast and complex web of pages called the internet. A small corner that represents me.
                And here, I will store whatever I feel like. Whatever I think is warranted to be shared with strangers online. Anything cool I make, or see, will, in some shape or form, end up over here.
                My projects and my entries. It's all for you view!
